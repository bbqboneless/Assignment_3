# Assignment_3
C file manipulation was the main topic for this lecture. As a consequence, 3 tasks were given to be performed that are shown as follows:
  1.  For excersise 1, a file checking program that checked the amount of characters, lines and words in a file, was done. The file name was to be passed as a command         argument. For this task, the file to be checked goes with the "testfile.txt" label. A screen shot of the result is provided as well ("file1.png").
  2.  For excersise 2, copying data from one document to another was done. For this, 2 files (a source and the copy) had to be created and are added into the repository.       The screenshot with the resunt is provided as well ("copy.png").
  3.  For excersise 3, checking program performance was checked with the "time" command. I checked differences in performance when passing the filenames as a command and       directly into the code, but apparently it's the same. Maybe when checking with larger files, there would be a noticeable change or shift on the time.
